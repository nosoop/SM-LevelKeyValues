# Level KeyValues
A helper plugin that transforms the level's entity string into a `KeyValues` handle.

## Information

The plugin's `KeyValues` handle only does reads.  Any modifications to the `KeyValues` structure are not applied to the map entities.

This was mostly meant as a proof-of-concept (I was interested in reading output rules for a better round win command).
Never really got around to designing a decent API for property manipulation as [Stripper:Source] does.
